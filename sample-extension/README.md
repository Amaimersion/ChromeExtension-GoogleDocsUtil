# Sample Extension: gDocs Selected Text

A sample Google Chrome extension which does three things:

1. Creates a [page action](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/pageAction)
2. Injects a [content script](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts) into the Google Doc page you are viewing.
3. When activated, the page action requests the selected text from the Google doc, and displays it in the popup.

**Note:** You must reload the Google Doc page after installing or updating the extension.

You can load the extension directly by following the [getting started instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest).
